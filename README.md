# Challenge 1 - Gameboy

## Threejs Journey Challenges

This is my entry to challenge one of the Threejs Journey Challenge series. The theme for this challenge was 'Gameboy'.

Using **[this](https://twitter.com/christophgromer/status/1671272211502473216?s=20)** beautiful render by gromer.png as inspiration, I attempted to create a similar scene in a real-time rendering environment.

I decided to use r3f so I could try out the MeshTransmissionMaterial included in the Drei library. It's quite a performant intesive shader so I used it for the main components of the model and some cheaper shaders for the details.

I also decided to use a model of a Gameboy Advance SP instead of a classic Gameboy. This is reflective of my childhood era and the device in the Gameboy family that brings back the best memories for me.
